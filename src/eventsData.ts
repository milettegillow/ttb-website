Thank you so happy we were able to make this happen!“ <br /> “Truly a one-of-a-kind experience for me. I really enjoyed the challenge of going from zero to an MVP in just one day - it pushed us beyond our limits and forced us to deliver a pitch by the end. The event required a wide range of skills, from creativity and innovation to collaboration and public speaking. I think it all came together really well, and I’m incredibly grateful to have been a part of it.“ <br /> “The atmosphere was great and loved how non-serious it was, made it all feel very comfortable. It was a first time for me attending such an event and it definitely has opened my mind up to possibilities!“ <br /> “It has been a lovely day and I met lots of wonderful people at the event.

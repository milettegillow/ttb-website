              Female-founded startups are objectively more successful than
              startups with all-male teams, consistently outperforming them.
              However, the funding disproportionately goes to all-male teams;
              79% of founding teams are entirely male, receiving 86% of venture
              funding, whereas the 7% of all-female teams only receive 2% of
              venture funding.

              We don't believe funding women is a charitable endeavour. Rather,
              it is a commercial endeavour which many investors are,
              unfortunately, missing out on due to hidden biases in their
              thinking. Partnering with The Tech Bros will not only give you
              access to our incredible talent pool, but to a community where
              these biases are less prevalent.
